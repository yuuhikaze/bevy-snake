# Bevy Snake

Playing around with Bevy, pretty great experience.

For this game I followed the tutorial from [Marcus Blog](https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/)

You can use this repo as a more up to date reference for the code shown in the tutorial.

# Plans

-   Make a game over screen
-   Separate input from direction (fixes a collission bug)
-   Make graphics more interesting
-   Have a scoreboard
